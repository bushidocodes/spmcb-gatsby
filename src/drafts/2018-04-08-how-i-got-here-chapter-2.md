As I've gotten older and gained perspective on my life, I've concluded that many aspects of my personality and career have been broadly shaped by the era, location, and community of my childhood. In this blog series, I'd like to retrospect on a few different periods of my life and some of their lasting influences on my professional pursuits and hobbies.

### Chapter 2: It takes a village

After getting exposed to computers and the world wide web at Amdahl, it was clear to me that I needed to learn more about computers. When I was at the house of a friend or family member and I saw a computer, I would immediately ask to use it. My Opa, Richard Grokenberger, taught me how to use MS-DOS and he showed me how to start Wolfenstein 3D. When I was at library, I'd pick up random books from the computer section and read bits and pieces or [use their orange monochrome terminals to explore the world wide web through a program called lynx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFF0oQySsh4). The goofy terminals didn't have a mouse, so my left pinky finder would got sore hitting the tab key all the time to move around HTML pages.

Folks at my church later took an interest in my hobby, and they started donating old computers from their attics and basements to create a computer lab that I could tinker with. This gave me access to a room with an [original IBM PC with big flappy red switch in the back on the right](https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-use-the-first-IBM-Personal-Computer), a knockoff Compaq, and a bunch of other weird personal computers that got wiped out by the IBM PC. When the pastor came in, I loaded up [Bible Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQnB5QrQWA8).

These occasional computational hits were a great pleasure to me, but I had become an addict, so one thing was crystal clear to me:

_I needed a computer at home._

The problem with this was that, compared to some of my more well off friends, my family was financially hard-up after my dad got injured at the [Mare Island Naval Shipyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Island_Naval_Shipyard). At this time, a home computer was a serious luxury good, and we just couldn't muster the resources for it. One day, I walked in and saw a [bunch of boxes of Gateway computers in their distinctive cow boxes](https://youtu.be/duwqWCNuEmI?t=15s). I thought Christmas had arrived early. Only later, I learned that these boxes were part of some rebate - resell side hustle, and we wouldn't be keeping a single computer.

I was crestfallen, and I suppose that my dad took pity on me, because he said that if I was willing to build a computer instead of buying one, he'd hire me to do chores around the house to pay for the parts. This build-don't-buy philosophy likely related to the fact that my father had been trained to work on electronic components in nuclear submarines. This would be an opportunity to support my interest in computers, work together on a father-son electronics project, and learn how to budget and bargain shop.

Thus began a multi-month oddessey going to [popup "Computer Show and Sale" events throughout Northern California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVvd733siBM). I drew up a list of all the different parts that I needed for a working computer, and I bought them piece by piece over the course of many weeks. At the computer shows, I would bargain with the vendors and try to negotiate down the prices of the individual components. I bought a Pentium chip here, a couple of Taiwanese memory chips there, and eventually getting everything I needed. I popped in my MS-DOS floppy diskette and my Windows 95 CD-ROM, and I got to work partitioning and formating the hard drive and installing the operating system. Once the system booted, I took a closer look at what else was on the CD, and I noticed a video file. I double clicked, and [Weezer's Buddy Holly music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERqsrkwJnJs) started playing. Too bad my sound card drivers weren't cooperating!

Stay tuned for the next post to hear about how my computer obsession led to fail out of seventh grade and land a part-time job.
